# Apple Health *(iOS)*

## Connect Your Tracker to Apple Health

Apple Health lets you keep all your fitness data in one place. By connecting your tracker to Apple Health, you'll be able to sync steps, distance, and more with HustleX.

Most iOS fitness trackers (like Google Fit) automatically sync with Apple Health, so no additional setup is required.
